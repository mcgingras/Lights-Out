# Lights Out!

lil puzzler game to learn react-native a bit better. also realized this is a good way to learn lin-alg.

hope it is fun!

things we could add
- timer for levels
- better layout (so changing view -> text doesnt wreck it)
- better architecture (modularize board view from stateful to view)
- more complex levels? (new game mechanics?)
- make logo better
- load font to async redux pattern
- neon design
- Do a interactive jupiter notebook (Streamlit?) so people can play with solutions
