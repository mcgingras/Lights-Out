# mosaic

lil puzzler game to learn react-native a bit better.
hope it is fun!

things we could add
- timer for levels
- better colors
- highlight (double tap to confirm move)
- better layout (so changing view -> text doesnt wreck it)
- better architecture (modularize board view from stateful to view)
- more complex levels? (new game mechanics?)
- analyze all possible levels somehow
- less repeatable combos
- loading / welcome screen
- tutorial
- load font to async redux pattern
- progress (what levels have been completed already)
- Do a interactive jupiter notebook (Streamlit?) so people can play with solutions
